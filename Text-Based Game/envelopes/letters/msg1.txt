| Hello, Dear.                                               |
|                                                            |
| For your information, you all are completely unaware that  |
| aside from you 11 little fellas, I also came here to join  |
| your celebration. I would like to have fun with you! And   |
| I'm glad to say that you're officially at the start of the |
| game. Do you know? I captured all of your ten classmates   |
| and congratulations on finding one of them! It's just that,|
| you haven't saved him *devil's laugh*. Do you want to save |
| the others? All you need to do is to guess in what order I |
| have planned to kill all 10 of them. I will give you six   |
| chances. Each wrong guess costs the life of the next person|
| on my list.                                                |
|                                                            |
| Just write your guess on a piece of paper, leave it in the |
| living room, and go back to your room. After a while, if   |
| you hear your friends, then you have saved them. But if you|
| hear a scream, just try again I guess? Let's have a clean  |
| game. Try to disobey the rules and all of them are dead.   |
|                                                            |
| NOTE: Use 0 as the first order and 9 as the last order.    |
| Write your answer based on this arrangement:               |
| [Alessandra][Demitre][Democritus][Gregoria][Issa]          |
| [Johannes][Julia][Lothar][Rainie][Ramir]                   |
| For example: 4510298637                                    |
|                                                            |
| *devil's laugh fading out*"                                |
